        -   Take a string argument `name`.
        -   Return a greeting in the format: `"Hello, <name>"`.
        -   Each time `greet` is called, the contract should:
            -   Store the provided `name` in an array called `submittedNames`.
    -   Implement an endpoint in the smart contract that:
        -   Returns the `submittedNames` array.
        -   This endpoint should be accessible from the frontend to display all previously submitted names.
    -   Build a frontend on ICP to interact with the smart contract, including:
        -   An input field where users can enter the `name` argument and call the `greet` function.
        -   A button to retrieve and display the `submittedNames` array.
        -   Deploy the frontend on ICP, either by:
            -   Using an [asset canister](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/web-apps/application-frontends/existing-frontend), or
            -   Deploying via [Juno.build](https://juno.build/docs/guides/manual-deployment).

# Tracks

Tracks are larger, open-ended projects with broader requirements and a higher reward pool. Each Track leverages unique features of the Internet Computer (ICP), enabling you to create applications that push the boundaries of blockchain technology. The Tracks are designed to build on top of the skills developed in the Bountys, giving you a solid foundation to tackle these more ambitious projects. Below are the available Tracks, each with a distinct focus and inspiration for your submissions.

## 1) **Fully On-Chain Dapps**

The Internet Computer (ICP) is a third-generation blockchain, serving as a permissionless, decentralized cloud built on blockchain technology. Its smart contracts, known as canisters, are more akin to decentralized servers than traditional smart contracts, representing an evolution in blockchain-based applications. Due to their powerful nature, canisters can run general-purpose and even enterprise-level applications, offering flexibility far beyond typical smart contracts. With canisters, developers can build powerful dapps and services that benefit from 1-2 second transaction finality, enabling a user experience (UX) that closely resembles the speed and responsiveness customers are used to from web2 applications.

What makes ICP stand out is its combination of [cross-chain capabilities and unique protocol features](https://www.notion.so/ICP-Hackathon-Cheat-Sheet-b2921239266149de81021412f572351c?pvs=21) you won’t find on any other blockchain:

-   **Low-cost, massive storage**: Store up to 400GB of data in a canister smart contract for just $5 per GB per year, making it ideal for hosting dapp frontends or large datasets.
-   **Smart contracts that can make HTTPS requests**: Build apps that seamlessly integrate web2 services directly into web3.
-   **Timers**: Execute code at specific intervals to create features for recurring payments, automated DeFi strategies, periodic oracle updates, and more.
-   **Secure randomness**: True on-chain randomness opens up use cases for gaming, governance, fair auctions, etc.
-   **External wallet login**: Sign in with Ethereum or Solana wallets to applications hosted on ICP. Linking of external blockchain accounts with ICP accounts allows for using ICP as an ETH/SOL/BTC L2.
-   **Serve content over HTTPS**: Canisters can natively serve HTTP, enabling hosting of websites or serving APIs from a smart contract without additional software.
-   **Reverse gas model**: Massively improve your UX by freeing end users from paying for transactions they perform when interacting with your dapp.
-   **Long-running, multi-block transactions** that even allow running AI inference.
-   **Chain Fusion**: chain-key Schnorr and chain-key ECDSA support, enabling seamless interaction with Bitcoin, EVM chains, Solana, and more. With chain-key cryptography, ICP smart contracts can also natively hold ETH, BTC, and other tokens, allowing them to sign transactions across these networks.

These features enable applications that simply **can’t be built anywhere else**, setting ICP apart from other blockchain platforms.

### Challenge

Leverage the unique power of ICP to build an app that **couldn't be built anywhere else**! Take advantage of features like seamless cross-chain interoperability, chain-key cryptography, or HTTPS outcalls. Whether it’s enabling Bitcoin payments directly from an ICP smart contract, executing Ethereum smart contract logic across chains, or hosting a multichain dapp with massive low-cost storage, your app should showcase what can only be achieved on ICP. The goal is to create a dapp that pushes the boundaries of blockchain technology by integrating ICP’s unparalleled multichain capabilities and making cross-chain complexity invisible to users.

### Guidance

**Ideas for inspiration:**

-   **Onchain games:** Simple dice or card games that use ICP’s secure randomness for fair gameplay.
-   **Reminder service:** A canister that relies on timers and HTTPS outcalls to send you notifications at certain times. Monitor onchain transactions or send yourself any reminder at a future date.
-   **Prediction Market:** Start simple by using HTTPS outcalls to resolve predictions for a specific topic. Think about using timers to automatically trigger the HTTPS outcalls to handle resolution. Long term think about an alternative to Polymarket.
-   **Decentralized Data Aggregator:** Build a dapp that uses HTTPS outcalls on ICP to fetch real-time off-chain data from various sources (e.g., stock prices, weather, or APIs) and aggregate it on-chain for use by other applications.
-   **Facilitate a Stripe Payment**: Use HTTP outcalls from an ICP canister to process payments via Stripe.
-   **Unity Game Integration**: Integrate a Unity game with Internet Identity (II) for login, and store high scores or user items in a canister using the C# SDK.
-   **Whistleblower Platform**: Create a secure platform for anonymous whistleblowing, using vetkeys for additional security.

### What We’re Looking For

## 2) **Chain Fusion**

Leverage Internet Computer's new [Chain Fusion](https://internetcomputer.org/chainfusion) technology to build or extend a cross-chain dApp that integrates ICP with any other chain, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. Using Chain Fusion, you can connect these chains directly without bridges, oracles, or intermediaries. ICP canister smart contracts are capable of signing Ethereum or Bitcoin transactions directly via [ICP's threshold signing API](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/encryption/t-ecdsa/), and they can read from other networks through integrations like [ICP’s Bitcoin API](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/multi-chain/bitcoin/overview) or [EVM RPC](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/multi-chain/ethereum/evm-rpc/overview) calls, or through custom [HTTPS outcalls](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/advanced-features/https-outcalls/https-outcalls-overview).

### Challenge

Build a dapp that demonstrates ICP's cross-chain capabilities through Chain Fusion, with flexibility to integrate any blockchain-related functionality you choose. Your dApp should highlight practical uses of Chain Fusion and showcase ICP’s unique cross-chain features. Ideas may include automating tasks on Ethereum, building fully on-chain apps that leverage Chain Fusion, or experimenting with cross-chain DeFi applications using ckBTC or ckETH tokens.

### Guidance
